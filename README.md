  <h1>How this plugin works</h1>
  <h2>1. Visitor subscribes to your main AWeber list.</h2>
  <p>
    Bob comes to your website, decides he'd like to receive news from you in his email inbox.<br/>
    He fills out the form and discovers that he can subscribe to additional lists as well.<br/>
    He makes a selection and proceeds by clicking on <b>'Submit'</b>.
  </p>
  <h2>2. Visitor receives the confirmation email.</h2>
  <p>
    Bob receives confirmation email in his inbox, opens it up and clicks on <b>'Confirm'</b> button.<br/>
    He is immediately taken to your website <b>where this plugin subscribes him to additional lists</b> of his choice.
  </p>
  <h2>3. Visitor receives additional confirmation emails.</h2>
  <p>
    Bob receives additional confirmation emails from every list he decided to subscribe to <b>additionally.</b></br></br>
    Please keep in mind: AWeber does not allow subscribing users to mailing lists without their permission.</br>
    As they say, "That's done to prevent malicious subscriptions and false spam allegations".</br></br>
    In the end, though, you don't have to create the whole myriad of forms and user doesn't have to fill them all out!</br>
    User would just need to spend 10-30 seconds on confirming the additional subscriptions in his email inbox!

  <h1>Here's what's required from you:</h1>
  <p>
    Good news! You still manage everything related to email campaigns at AWeber website.<br/>
    This plugin does not require any additional configuration on the Wordpress side.<br/><br/>
    There are only two rules you have to follow at AWeber in order to enable automatic subscriptions:</br>
  </p>
  <h2>1. Make sure you use proper 'Field Names' for your custom fields on your AWeber form.</h2>
  <p>
    When you create a custom field for your AWeber form (<b>List Options > Custom Fields</b>),<br/>
    it first asks you which '<b>Field Name</b>' you want to use, then on the next slide,<br/>
    it asks for 'Field Label' and some other options that are not relevant for the plugin.<br/><br/>
    Make sure that for every new field you create, you set the '<b>Field Name</b>' value to<br/>
    the '<b>ID</b>' of the corresponding AWeber list (like <b>awlist5279237</b>).<br/><br/>
    Automatic subscriptions are not possible without an association system like this.<br/>
    You can get a list ID at <b>List Options > List Settings > (look under the list name)</b> 
  </p>
  <h2>2. Make sure your main AWeber list redirects people to your website upon subscription confirmation.</h2>
  <p>
    By saying main list, I mean list that your AWeber form on your website is bound to.<br/>
    You can set this setting in <b>List Options > List Settings > Confirmation Message > Confirmation Success Page</b>.<br/><br/>
    Redirection to your website is important because <b>that's where this plugin does it's job</b>, on your website.</br>
    I recommend setting up a separate page for that. It doesn't have to be nothing fancy, but just being a <b>separate</b> page.
